    <h2>Friday October 14th</h2>
    <h3>id="blog1-bracket">Bracket</h3>
    <p1>Hello world! I recently got back from Big House 10! 
        For those who don't know what that is, it's pretty much 
        a large gaming tournament in Detroit for the game Super Smash Brother Ultimate.
        I had a great time and improved a lot. I went 2-2 in singles almost getting out
        of round 1 of pools, or the first bracket, but I unfortunately lost my final match to get out.
        The person I was playing had their boyfriend giving them advice during the set which was 
        really frustrating and likely illegal, but it's already too late to say something.</p1>
    
    <h3>Vendors</h3>
    <p1>There were a lot of vendors at the event, so I ended ended up spending a lot of money.
        My biggest buy was a brand new custom controller. It matches with the theme of the event being yellow 
        and blue and looks so dam cool! The only unfortuate part is that they are U of M colors, however, I think 
        the event is distinct enough where most people would not consider me a traitor of MSU using the contoller. 
        I also bought some plushies, a beanie, a mask, and some pins for my event lanyard.</p1>     

    <h3>Keynotes</h3>
    <p1>Some other keynotes were that...</p1>

    <li>I won a money match against my friend</li>
    <li>I ran a Smash Melee bracket as an organizer (with no experience playing the game)</li>
    <li>I played the 2nd best player in the US of my character (Inkling) and did well</li>
    <li>I had a really fun adventure with my friend who 
        lost his car in the MGM garage for 45 minutes</li>
           
     <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
    <p1>Overwall, I had a great time and am looking forward to going again next year!</p1>>
