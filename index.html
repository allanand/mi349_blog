    <h3>testing</h3>

    <p1>Hello world! I recently got back from Big House 10! 
        For those who don't know what that is, it's pretty much 
        a large gaming tournament in Detroit for the game Super Smash Brother Ultimate.
        I had a great time and improved a lot. I went 2-2 in singles almost getting out
        of round 1 of pools, or the first bracket, but I unfortunately lost my final match to get out.
        The person I was playing had their boyfriend giving them advice during the set which was 
        really frustrating and likely illegal, but it's already too late to say something.</p1>
      
        Test
      
        <h3>There were a lot of vendors at the event, so I ended ended up spending a lot of money.
            My biggest buy was a brand new custom controller. It matches with the theme of the event being yellow 
            and blue and looks so dam cool! The only unfortuate part is that they are U of M colors, however, I think 
            the event is distinct enough where most people would not consider me a traitor of MSU using the contoller. 
            I also bought some plushies, a beanie, a mask, and some pins for my event lanyard.</h3>

              
              <p3>Some other keynotes were that I won a money match against my friend,
                 ran a Melee bracket as an organizer (with no experience playing the game), played the 2nd best player in the US 
                 of my character (Inkling) and did well, and lastly had a really funny adventure with my friend who 
                lost his car in the MGM garage. </p3>
                
                <p4>Overwall, I had a great time and am looking forward to going again next year!</p4>
