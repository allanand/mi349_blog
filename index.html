<H2>Rough Week</H2>

<h3>Post Big House</h3>
<p><strong>Hello world!</strong> After returning from <a href="#2">Big House</a> I had a lot of homework to make up. This resulted in 
me doing homework for nearly 8 hours every day! I got little to no sleep during this period resulting in 
me offloading my sleep Thursday only putting me more behind on work.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Hurt My Finger</h3>
<p>Thursday morning I woke up and my ring finger hurt. The night before I played some games online with friends
for a few hours, but it was nothing really demanding, so I have no idea why it may have hurt. As a result of this 
happening, I had to cancel plans to play games with my Friends in person Thursday night. Some of my friends thought 
I was making excuses which just made it even more frustrating. 
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Other Annoying Stuff</h3>
<ul class="Annoying">
    <li>I Found out I have to redo a class project </li>
    <li>I burned soup all over my stove </li>
    <li>I had to miss the MSU football game to finish an assignment</li>
    <li>My Amazon order did not arrive on time</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The Upside</h3>
<p>While this week did suck, I at least had a good time Wednesday with my friends online and Friday at Smash Club. For those that do not know, Fridays is when MSU Smash Ultimate club hosts their weekly event. Since I am the Vice President of the club, I have a lot of responsibilities and must be there. However, I always have a fun time organizing the event, hanging out with all of my friends, and competing. While I did not compete too well because I could not play all week, I still learned a lot and had a good time overall. Afterwards, we also ended up going to Blaze pizza and I had the most tasty meat lovers pizza with bbq sauce!
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>From now on, I am making sure I plan better so I don't have so much homework. I did all of my homework until Monday, but that was unfortunately not enough.

<H2>Big House 10 Experience</H2>
<p>By Andrew Allan </p>
<p>Sunday, October 9th, 2022</p>

<h3>Bracket</h3>

<p><strong>Hello world!</strong> I recently got back from Big House 10! 
For those who don't know what that is, it's pretty much 
a large gaming tournament at the Cobo Center Detroit for the game Super Smash Brother Ultimate.
I had a great time and improved a lot. I went 2-2 in singles almost getting out
of round 1 of pools, or the first bracket, but I unfortunately lost my final match to get out.
The person I was playing had their boyfriend giving them advice during the set which was 
really frustrating and likely illegal, but it's already too late to say something.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
    
<h3>Vendors</h3>
<p>There were a lot of vendors at the event, so I ended ended up spending a lot of money.
My biggest buy was a brand new custom controller. It matches with the theme of the event being yellow 
and blue and looks so dam cool! The only unfortuate part is that they are U of M colors, however, I think 
the event is distinct enough where most people would not consider me a traitor of MSU for using the contoller. 
I also bought some plushies, a beanie, a mask, and some pins for my event lanyard.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>     
    
<h3>Other Keynotes</h3>
<ul class="keynotes">
    <li>I won a money match against my friend</li>
    <li>I ran a Smash Melee bracket as an organizer (with no experience playing the game)</li>
    <li>I played the 2nd best player in the US of my character (Inkling) and did well</li>
    <li>I had a really fun adventure with my friend who lost his car in the MGM garage for 45 minutes</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
    
<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>Overall, I had a great time and am looking forward to going again next year!
If you have never been to a Smash Tournament before, you should totally give shot
because it can be a lot of fun! Even if you are not good at the game,
there are a lot of other activities you can do while there like play the arcade machines, 
or enter fun side brackets for other Nintendo games.
