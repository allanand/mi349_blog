<h3>Bracket</h3>
<p><strong>Hello world!</strong> I recently got back from Big House 10! 
For those who don't know what that is, it's pretty much 
a large gaming tournament at the Cobo Center Detroit for the game Super Smash Brother Ultimate.
I had a great time and improved a lot. I went 2-2 in singles almost getting out
of round 1 of pools, or the first bracket, but I unfortunately lost my final match to get out.
The person I was playing had their boyfriend giving them advice during the set which was 
really frustrating and likely illegal, but it's already too late to say something.
</p>

<h3>Vendors</h3>
<p>There were a lot of vendors at the event, so I ended ended up spending a lot of money.
My biggest buy was a brand new custom controller. It matches with the theme of the event being yellow 
and blue and looks so dam cool! The only unfortuate part is that they are U of M colors, however, I think 
the event is distinct enough where most people would not consider me a traitor of MSU for using the contoller. 
I also bought some plushies, a beanie, a mask, and some pins for my event lanyard.
</p>     

<h3>Keynotes</h3>
<p>Some other keynotes were that...</p>
<ul class="keynotes">
    <li>I won a money match against my friend</li>
    <li>I ran a Smash Melee bracket as an organizer (with no experience playing the game)</li>
    <li>I played the 2nd best player in the US of my character (Inkling) and did well</li>
    <li>I had a really fun adventure with my friend who lost his car in the MGM garage for 45 minutes</li>
</ul>
         
<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>Overall, I had a great time and am looking forward to going again next year!
If you have never been to a Smash Tournament before, you should totally give shot
because it can be a lot of fun! Even if you are not good at the game,
there are a lot of other activities you can do while there like play the arcade machines, 
or enter fun side brackets for other Nintendo games.
