                <h3>Basics</h3>
                <p>My name is Andrew Allan! I am 22 years old and was born in Bridgeport, Connecticut. 
                I have lived in Michigan for nearly 20 years, however, I currently live in East Lansing, Michigan.

                <h3>Education</h3>
                <p>I am a Senior at Michigan State University majoring in Information Science. My degree focuses on creating 
                human centered design. This mean that I will design prototypes based on users input. This could be something physical 
                like a 3D printed phone holder or digital like a blog website. 
                </p>
